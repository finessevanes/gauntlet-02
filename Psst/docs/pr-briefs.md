### Phase 1: MVP Polish & UX Enhancement

#### PR #006E: new-chat-sheet-redesign

**Brief:** Complete redesign of the New Chat sheet for improved usability and visual polish: move search to top (below segmented control instead of bottom), modernize segmented control to current iOS style, add blue checkmark selection indicators with Done button for group creation, implement auto-navigation for 1-on-1 chats (tap user â†’ immediately navigate, no Done button needed), enhance user rows with 56pt avatars and better spacing (72pt height), add tap animations (scale to 0.98, background flash), implement haptic feedback, move user count to section header (remove from nav bar), and create skeleton loading states. This is the fifth and final piece of the app-wide design system overhaul following PR #006A (design system), #006B (main app polish), #006C (settings), and #006D (profile), completing the cohesive modern interface across the entire app.

## ðŸŽ¯ Todo / In Progress

### Phase 1: MVP Polish & UX Enhancement (Ordered by Criticality)

#### PR #001: profile-photo-upload-reliability-fix

**Brief:** Fix critical user experience issues with profile photo handling: (1) New users unable to upload profile photos on first attempt, requiring multiple retries due to threading problems in ProfilePhotoPicker, compression logic failures in UserService.uploadProfilePhoto(), insufficient error handling, potential Firebase Storage permission issues, and lack of network state validation. (2) Profile photos load every time the app opens instead of being cached, creating jarring loading experiences for users. Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages, add network connectivity checks before uploads, improve threading safety in image processing pipeline, add retry mechanisms for failed uploads, enhance compression logic with better error handling, add detailed logging for debugging upload failures, and implement local image caching with proper cache invalidation so profile photos load instantly from cache when available with background refresh for updated photos. Ensure the fix works reliably for all image types and sizes while maintaining the existing compression and storage security rules.

**Dependencies:** PR #17 (user profile editing)

**Complexity:** Medium

**Phase:** 1 (MVP Polish)

**Status:** ðŸŽ¯ TODO

#### PR #002: message-delivery-status-indicator-fix

**Brief:** Fix the "Delivered" status indicator to only show on the latest message instead of appearing under every message bubble, matching iOS Messages behavior. Currently, the delivery status appears under all sent messages which creates visual clutter and doesn't follow standard messaging app patterns. Implement logic to track the latest message in each conversation and only display the delivery status indicator on that message, automatically moving the indicator to newer messages as they are sent. This creates a cleaner, more professional chat experience that follows iOS design patterns.

**Dependencies:** PR #7 (chat view UI), PR #8 (messaging service)

**Complexity:** Medium

**Phase:** 1 (MVP Polish)

#### PR #003: presence-indicator-redesign-and-unread-badges

**Brief:** Redesign the presence indicator system to use a halo effect around user profile photos instead of the current online/offline circle. Implement unread message indicators that show a blue halo or badge when there are unread messages in a chat. Update the presence system to be more visually appealing and intuitive, with the halo effect providing a cleaner, more modern look. Ensure the unread indicators are clearly visible and update in real-time as messages are read or received. This redesign should improve the overall visual hierarchy and make it easier for users to quickly identify who is online and which chats have unread messages.

**Dependencies:** PR #12 (presence system), PR #14 (read receipts)

**Complexity:** Medium

**Phase:** 1 (MVP Polish)

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED

#### PR #004: group-online-indicators-and-member-status

**Brief:** Implement comprehensive group chat online indicators that show which members are currently online, following WhatsApp/Signal conventions. Currently, the presence system only works for one user at a time, making it difficult to know who's active in group conversations. Add group member online status indicators that display next to each member's name in the group chat header or member list. Show a small green dot or halo effect for online members and gray for offline members. Implement real-time updates so the online status changes immediately when members come online or go offline. This should work seamlessly with the existing presence system and provide clear visual feedback about group activity.

**Dependencies:** PR #12 (presence system), PR #11 (group chat support)

**Complexity:** Medium

**Phase:** 1 (MVP Polish)

#### PR #005: group-read-receipts-detailed-view

**Brief:** Replace the generic "1/2 have read" read receipt display with detailed information showing exactly who has read each message in group chats. Currently, users only see a count of who has read messages, but not the specific names. Implement a detailed read receipt system that shows individual member names who have read each message, similar to WhatsApp's read receipt system. Allow users to tap on read receipts to see a detailed list of who has read the message and when. This should work for both sent and received messages, with clear visual indicators and smooth animations. The system should handle large groups efficiently and provide a professional, intuitive way to track message read status.

#### PR #006: authentication-ui-redesign-and-color-scheme

**Brief:** Redesign the authentication screens to be cleaner and less cluttered, focusing on two primary sign-in options (email/password and Google) with a simple sign-up option. Implement a cohesive color scheme inspired by modern weather apps with gradient backgrounds that reflect the app's mood and purpose. Simplify the login screen to show only essential elements: app branding, two sign-in buttons (Email and Google), and a subtle sign-up link. Move the detailed sign-up form to a separate screen accessible only when needed. Apply the new color scheme consistently across all authentication screens with smooth gradients, modern typography, and improved visual hierarchy. Remove visual clutter like excessive dividers, redundant buttons, and overwhelming form elements. Ensure the design follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines while creating a distinctive, modern look that sets Psst apart from generic messaging apps.

#### PR #007: app-launch-loading-screen-and-skeleton

**Brief:** Implement a smooth app launch experience by replacing the brief login screen flash with a proper loading screen or skeleton UI when users reopen the app. Currently, users who were previously logged in see the login screen for a second before being redirected to the main app, creating a jarring user experience. Create a loading screen with app branding, skeleton UI components that match the main app layout, and smooth transitions. The loading screen should appear immediately on app launch while Firebase Authentication checks the user's login status in the background. Once authentication is confirmed, smoothly transition to the main app without showing the login screen. This creates a more professional, seamless user experience that matches modern app standards.

#### PR #008: message-timestamp-tap-to-reveal

**Brief:** Replace the current swipe gesture for viewing message timestamps with a simple tap interaction. Currently, users must swipe left or right on messages to reveal timestamps, which is not intuitive and can be difficult to discover. Implement a tap-to-reveal system where users can tap on any message to show its timestamp for a few seconds before it automatically fades back. This should work for both sent and received messages, with smooth animations for the timestamp appearance and disappearance. The timestamp should be clearly visible and positioned appropriately relative to the message bubble. This creates a more discoverable and user-friendly way to view message timing information, following modern messaging app patterns.

**Complexity:** Simple

#### PR #009: basic-media-support-and-image-messaging

**Brief:** Implement basic media support to allow users to send and receive images in conversations. This includes adding image picker functionality to the message input, uploading images to Firebase Storage, displaying images in chat messages, and handling image compression for optimal performance. Users should be able to select images from their photo library or take new photos with the camera. Implement proper image loading states, error handling for failed uploads, and thumbnail generation for better performance. Images should display inline within the chat conversation with proper sizing and aspect ratio handling. This basic media support is essential for a complete messaging experience and addresses a core requirement for modern messaging apps.

**Dependencies:** PR #8 (messaging service), PR #17 (user profile editing for image handling)
