## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

- **Questions**: None - this is a clear UI polish update
- **Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed)**:
  - All existing features work unchanged (online status, unread badges, sender names, typing indicators)
  - Uses design system from PR #006A (ButtonStyles, colors, typography, spacing grid)
  - FAB replaces nav bar "+" button functionality (opens same UserSelectionView)
