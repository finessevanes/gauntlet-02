# PRD: Group Online Indicators and Member Status

**Feature**: Group Chat Online Status Indicators

**Version**: 1.0

**Status**: Draft

**Agent**: Pam (Planning Agent)

**Target Release**: Phase 1 - MVP Polish

**Links**: 
- PR Brief: `Psst/docs/pr-briefs.md` (PR #004)
- TODO: `Psst/docs/todos/pr-004-todo.md` (to be created)
- Dependencies: PR #12 (presence system), PR #11 (group chat support)

---

## 1. Summary

Group chat users cannot see which members are currently online, making it difficult to know who is active and available for real-time conversation. This PR implements comprehensive group member online indicators that show real-time presence status for all participants in group conversations, following WhatsApp/Signal conventions with visual indicators (green dot/halo for online, gray for offline) next to each member's name or profile photo.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

**Problem**: 
The current presence system (`PresenceService`) only supports observing one user at a time, which works well for 1-on-1 chats but provides no visibility into which members are active in group conversations. Users have no way to know if their group chat messages will be seen immediately or if they're messaging inactive members.

**Why now**: 
Group chat functionality (PR #11) and presence system (PR #12) are complete, but the user experience is incomplete without group member status visibility. This is a critical UX gap that makes group chats feel less responsive and engaging compared to established messaging apps.

**Goals** (ordered, measurable):
- [] G1 — Enable users to see online status for all members in a group chat within 100ms of opening the chat
- [] G2 — Update online indicators in real-time when any group member's status changes (<3 second latency)
- [] G3 — Display clear visual indicators (green for online, gray for offline) that match iOS design patterns
- [] G4 — Ensure group presence tracking doesn't impact app performance (maintains 60fps scrolling with 50+ member groups)

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

To maintain focus on core group presence functionality:

- [ ] Not implementing "last seen" timestamps (future enhancement - shows actual time user was last online)
- [ ] Not showing typing indicators in group chats (separate PR - requires different real-time mechanism)
- [ ] Not implementing custom status messages (future - "At work", "Busy", etc.)
- [ ] Not showing presence history or activity logs (out of scope for MVP)
- [ ] Not implementing presence-based sorting (e.g., showing online members first)
- [ ] Not adding presence notifications ("John came online")

---

## 4. Success Metrics

**User-visible metrics**:
- Time to see all member statuses: <100ms after opening group chat
- Visual clarity: Users can distinguish online vs offline at a glance (design validation)
- Flow completion: 100% of group chats show member status without errors

**System metrics** (from `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md`):
- Presence update latency: <3 seconds when member comes online/offline
- App load time: Remains <2-3 seconds (no regression)
- Scrolling performance: Maintains 60fps with 50+ member groups displaying presence
- Firebase Realtime DB reads: Batched efficiently (1 listener per member, not per UI element)

**Quality metrics**:
- 0 blocking bugs in group presence display
- All acceptance gates pass (see Section 12)
- Crash-free rate >99% with group presence active
- No memory leaks from presence listeners (verified with Instruments)

---

## 5. Users & Stories

**Primary User: Group Chat Participant**
- As a group chat member, I want to see which members are currently online so that I know if my messages will be read immediately
- As a group admin, I want to see who's active before starting a time-sensitive discussion so that I can ensure key members are present
- As a casual user, I want to glance at online indicators without opening member lists so that I can quickly assess group activity

**Secondary User: Power User with Multiple Groups**
- As a user in 10+ group chats, I want presence indicators to load quickly and not slow down my chat list so that I can navigate efficiently
- As a user on slow network, I want cached presence status to display immediately so that I have instant visual feedback even if real-time updates are delayed

---

## 6. Experience Specification (UX)

### Entry Points
1. **Group Chat View** (primary entry point)
   - User opens a group chat from chat list
   - Member online indicators appear immediately in chat header or message bubbles
   
2. **Group Member List** (secondary entry point)
   - User taps group name/header to view member list
   - Full member list displays with online status for each member
   
3. **Chat List Preview** (tertiary - future consideration)
   - Chat list could show "2 of 5 online" in subtitle (out of scope for this PR, but architecture should support it)

### Visual Behavior

**Online Indicator Design** (following WhatsApp/Signal conventions):
- **Small green dot** (8pt diameter) for online members
- **Gray circle** (8pt diameter, 50% opacity) for offline members
- Position: Bottom-right corner of profile photo (overlapping by 2pt)
- Animation: Smooth fade transition (0.3s) when status changes

**Group Chat Header Display**:
- Show first 3-5 member profile photos in a horizontal row
- Each photo shows online indicator overlay
- Tap header → full member list with all statuses

**Group Member List Display**:
- Vertical list of all members with profile photos
- Online indicator on each photo
- Optional: Section headers "Online (3)" and "Offline (7)" for large groups
- Real-time updates: indicators fade in/out as members come online/offline

**Message Bubble Display** (optional enhancement):
- Sender's online status shown next to their name in received messages
- Only show for recent messages (last 10 minutes) to avoid clutter

### Loading/Disabled/Error States

**Loading State**:
- Show gray indicator (default offline) while presence loads
- Presence should load within 100ms, so loading state is brief

**Error State**:
- If Firebase Realtime DB connection fails, show gray indicators with no updates
- Log error to console but don't show error UI (graceful degradation)
- Cache last known status and display until connection restored

**Disabled State**:
- If user has disabled presence sharing (future feature), show gray indicator for them
- Other members' statuses still display normally

**Empty State**:
- Single-member group (edge case): show "You" with online indicator
- No special handling needed - standard group UI applies

### Performance Targets (from `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md`)
- **Initial load**: All member statuses displayed within 100ms of opening group chat
- **Status updates**: Indicator changes within 3 seconds of actual status change in Firebase
- **Smooth animations**: 60fps fade transitions for status changes
- **No UI blocking**: Presence loading happens on background thread
- **Memory efficient**: Listener cleanup prevents leaks (verified in Instruments)

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (Must/Should)

### MUST Have (P0 - Required for MVP)

**M1: Group Presence Observation**
- MUST extend `PresenceService` to support observing multiple users simultaneously
- MUST batch presence listeners efficiently (1 listener per member, reuse existing listeners if already active)
- MUST clean up all listeners when leaving group chat (prevent memory leaks)
- MUST handle up to 50 members without performance degradation

**[Gate]** When user opens group with 10 members → all 10 presence statuses displayed within 100ms

**M2: Real-Time Status Updates**
- MUST update visual indicators within 3 seconds when any member comes online/offline
- MUST use Firebase Realtime Database `.value` listener for instant updates
- MUST batch updates to prevent UI thrashing (debounce rapid status changes)

**[Gate]** When member A goes online in group → all other members see green dot appear within 3 seconds

**M3: Visual Indicator Display**
- MUST show green dot (8pt) for online members
- MUST show gray dot (8pt, 50% opacity) for offline members
- MUST position indicator at bottom-right of profile photo
- MUST animate transitions smoothly (0.3s fade)

**[Gate]** Visual design review confirms indicators are clearly visible and match iOS patterns

**M4: Group Member List Integration**
- MUST display all members with online status in tappable member list
- MUST update list in real-time as statuses change
- MUST sort members by online status (online first) for groups >10 members

**[Gate]** When user taps group header → member list opens with all statuses visible and accurate

### SHOULD Have (P1 - Nice to Have)

**S1: Offline Caching**
- SHOULD cache last known presence status locally
- SHOULD display cached status immediately on app restart
- SHOULD update cache in background when fresh data arrives

**[Gate]** App restart shows last known status within 50ms, updates to live status within 3 seconds

**S2: Performance Optimization**
- SHOULD reuse existing presence listeners across multiple UI components
- SHOULD debounce rapid status changes (100ms window) to prevent excessive UI updates
- SHOULD unsubscribe from presence when group chat is in background

**[Gate]** Instruments profiling shows 0 memory leaks and <5% CPU usage for presence tracking with 20 active groups

**S3: Large Group Handling**
- SHOULD show "Show More" button for groups >10 members (only load first 10 initially)
- SHOULD lazy-load additional member presence on demand
- SHOULD paginate member list for groups >50 members

**[Gate]** Group with 100 members loads first 10 statuses in 100ms, full list in <2 seconds

---

## 8. Data Model

### Existing Models (No Changes Required)

**UserPresence** (from PR #12):
```swift
struct UserPresence: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: String           // User's Firebase UID
    var isOnline: Bool       // Online status
    var lastChanged: Date    // Timestamp of last status change
}
```

**Chat** (from PR #11):
```swift
struct Chat: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: String
    let members: [String]     // Array of user IDs in group
    var isGroupChat: Bool     // True for 3+ members
    var groupName: String?    // Group name (if applicable)
    // ... other fields
}
```

### New Model: GroupPresence (View Helper)

```swift
/// Convenience model for tracking multiple user presences in a group
/// Not stored in Firebase - ephemeral UI state only
struct GroupPresence {
    let chatID: String
    var memberPresences: [String: Bool]  // userID -> isOnline
    var listeners: [String: UUID]         // userID -> listenerID for cleanup
    
    var onlineCount: Int {
        memberPresences.values.filter { $0 }.count
    }
    
    var offlineCount: Int {
        memberPresences.count - onlineCount
    }
}
```

### Firebase Realtime Database Schema (Existing - No Changes)

**Path**: `/presence/{userID}`

```json
{
  "status": "online" | "offline",
  "lastChanged": 1234567890  // Server timestamp
}
```

### Validation Rules
- **Firebase Security Rules**: Already configured in PR #12 - users can read any presence, write only their own
- **Field Constraints**: Status must be "online" or "offline" (validated server-side)
- **Member Count**: Support up to 50 members initially (can increase if performance allows)

### Indexing/Queries
- No Firestore queries needed (uses Firebase Realtime Database)
- Each member presence accessed via direct path: `/presence/{userID}`
- No composite indexes required

---

## 9. API / Service Contracts

### PresenceService Extensions

**New Method: Observe Multiple Users**
```swift
/// Observe presence for multiple users simultaneously (for group chats)
/// Returns dictionary of listenerIDs keyed by userID for cleanup
/// - Parameters:
///   - userIDs: Array of user IDs to observe
///   - completion: Callback with userID and online status
/// - Returns: Dictionary mapping userID to listenerID for cleanup
func observeGroupPresence(
    userIDs: [String], 
    completion: @escaping (String, Bool) -> Void
) -> [String: UUID]

// Pre-conditions:
// - userIDs array is not empty (1-50 users)
// - Firebase Realtime DB is connected
// - User is authenticated

// Post-conditions:
// - Listener registered for each userID
// - Completion fires immediately with current status for each user
// - Completion fires on every subsequent status change
// - Returns map of userID -> listenerID for later cleanup

// Error handling:
// - If userID doesn't exist in presence DB, default to offline
// - Network errors logged but don't throw (graceful degradation)
```

**New Method: Stop Group Observation**
```swift
/// Stop observing presence for multiple users
/// Cleans up all listeners to prevent memory leaks
/// - Parameter listeners: Dictionary of userID -> listenerID from observeGroupPresence
func stopObservingGroup(listeners: [String: UUID])

// Pre-conditions:
// - listeners map contains valid listenerIDs from observeGroupPresence

// Post-conditions:
// - All specified listeners removed from Firebase
// - Memory released for each listener
// - Internal tracking dictionaries cleaned up

// Error handling:
// - Silently ignore invalid listenerIDs (defensive cleanup)
// - Ensure no partial cleanup (all-or-nothing)
```

**Optimization Method: Shared Listener**
```swift
/// Get or create shared presence listener for a user
/// Reuses existing listener if one is already active
/// - Parameters:
///   - userID: User ID to observe
///   - completion: Callback with online status
/// - Returns: listenerID for cleanup
func getSharedPresenceListener(
    userID: String, 
    completion: @escaping (Bool) -> Void
) -> UUID

// Pre-conditions:
// - userID is valid Firebase UID
// - Firebase Realtime DB connected

// Post-conditions:
// - If listener exists for userID, add this completion to its subscribers
// - If no listener exists, create new one
// - Returns unique listenerID even if reusing shared listener

// Error handling:
// - Network errors handled gracefully (return cached status)
```

## 10. UI Components to Create/Modify

### New Components

**`Views/Components/OnlineIndicator.swift`**
- Purpose: Reusable SwiftUI view for online/offline indicator dot
- Props: `isOnline: Bool`, `size: CGFloat = 8`
- Renders green or gray dot with fade animation

**`Views/Components/ProfilePhotoWithPresence.swift`**
- Purpose: Profile photo with online indicator overlay
- Props: `userID: String`, `photoURL: String?`, `size: CGFloat`
- Composable component combining profile photo + OnlineIndicator

**`Views/ChatList/GroupMemberStatusView.swift`**
- Purpose: Full member list showing all members with online status
- Shows sortable list: online members first, then offline
- Tappable list items for future member actions (view profile, etc.)

### Modified Components

**`Views/ChatList/ChatView.swift`**
- Add group presence observation when chat opens
- Display member presence in header (first 3-5 members)
- Add tap handler to show full member list
- Clean up listeners when view disappears

**`Views/ChatList/ChatRowView.swift`**
- Optionally show "X of Y online" subtitle for group chats
- This is low priority - can defer to future PR

**`Views/ChatList/MessageRow.swift`**
- Optionally show sender's online indicator next to their name (for recent messages)
- Low priority - can implement if time allows

### Service Layer Changes

**`Services/PresenceService.swift`** (extend existing)
- Add `observeGroupPresence()` method
- Add `stopObservingGroup()` method
- Add internal listener deduplication logic
- Enhance listener tracking to support shared listeners

---

## 11. Integration Points

### Firebase Realtime Database
- **Read**: Multi-user presence observation using `.value` listeners
- **Write**: No changes (users set their own status via existing `setOnlineStatus()`)
- **Offline Persistence**: Firebase Realtime DB automatically caches presence data

### PresenceService (Existing - from PR #12)
- **Integration**: Extend with group observation methods
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing methods (single-user observation) continue working unchanged
- **Listener Management**: Enhance internal tracking to prevent listener duplication

### ChatService (Existing - from PR #11)
- **Integration**: Fetch member list from `Chat.members` array
- **No API Changes**: Use existing chat data, just add presence layer on top

### State Management (SwiftUI)
- **ChatView**: Add `@State var groupPresence: GroupPresence?` to track member statuses
- **GroupMemberStatusView**: Add `@StateObject var presenceTracker: GroupPresenceTracker` (new ViewModel)
- **EnvironmentObject**: Inject shared `PresenceService` for efficiency

## 14. Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Performance Degradation with Large Groups
- **Risk**: Observing 50+ users simultaneously could slow down app or increase Firebase costs
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Implement lazy loading (load first 10, then paginate)
  - Debounce status updates (100ms window)
  - Unsubscribe from presence when group is in background
  - Monitor Firebase Realtime DB usage and optimize if needed

### Risk 2: Memory Leaks from Listeners
- **Risk**: Forgetting to clean up presence listeners could cause memory leaks
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Strict listener lifecycle management in ViewModels
  - Use SwiftUI `.onDisappear` to guarantee cleanup
  - Test with Xcode Instruments to verify no leaks
  - Add listener count logging in debug mode

### Risk 3: Firebase Realtime DB Rate Limits
- **Risk**: Too many simultaneous connections could hit Firebase rate limits
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Reuse listeners across UI components (shared listener pattern)
  - Batch presence updates instead of individual writes
  - Monitor Firebase usage dashboard
  - Implement exponential backoff for reconnections

### Risk 4: Inconsistent Status Across Devices
- **Risk**: Network delays or race conditions could show different statuses on different devices
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Always use Firebase server timestamps for status changes
  - Implement eventual consistency (brief mismatches are acceptable)
  - Add debug logging to track status change propagation
  - Test with multiple devices on different networks

### Risk 5: Battery Drain from Realtime Listeners
- **Risk**: Keeping many Firebase listeners active could drain battery
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Unsubscribe from presence when app is in background
  - Use Firebase connection state to pause listeners when offline
  - Implement connection pooling to reduce overhead
  - Test battery usage with Xcode Energy Diagnostics

---

## 15. Rollout & Telemetry

### Feature Flag
**No feature flag required** - this is a core group chat enhancement that should ship to all users immediately.

### Metrics to Monitor

**Usage Metrics**:
- % of group chats where users tap to view member list
- Average group size using presence feature
- % of users interacting with online members vs offline members

**Performance Metrics**:
- Average presence load time (target: <100ms)
- P95 status update latency (target: <3 seconds)
- Firebase Realtime DB read operations per user per day

**Error Metrics**:
- Presence load failure rate (target: <1%)
- Listener cleanup failures (target: 0%)
- Crash rate related to presence (target: 0%)

### Manual Validation Steps (Pre-Launch)
1. Test with 5-person group on 3 devices
2. Verify status updates appear on all devices within 3 seconds
3. Test network disconnection and reconnection
4. Verify Instruments shows no memory leaks after 10 group opens/closes
5. Confirm smooth scrolling with 50-member group
6. Visual design review confirms indicators match iOS patterns

## 16. Open Questions

### Q1: Should we show "last seen" timestamps for offline members?
- **Decision Needed**: WhatsApp shows "last seen 2 hours ago"
- **Recommendation**: Defer to future PR - adds complexity to data model and privacy concerns
- **Owner**: Product (user feedback after MVP launch)

### Q2: Should we sort members by online status in member list?
- **Decision Needed**: Online first vs alphabetical
- **Recommendation**: Online first for groups >10 members (easier to find active members)
- **Owner**: Design (visual hierarchy validation)

### Q3: What's the maximum supported group size for presence?
- **Decision Needed**: 50? 100? 500?
- **Recommendation**: Start with 50, monitor performance, increase if metrics allow
- **Owner**: Engineering (performance testing)

### Q4: Should we show online count in chat list subtitle?
- **Decision Needed**: "3 of 10 online" vs just group name
- **Recommendation**: Defer to future PR - adds visual clutter to chat list
- **Owner**: Design (information hierarchy)

---

## 17. Appendix: Out-of-Scope Backlog

Items deferred for future PRs:

- [ ] **"Last seen" timestamps** - Show "last seen 2h ago" for offline members

- [ ] **Presence notifications** - "John came online" alerts
- [ ] **Presence-based sorting** - Sort chat list by online members
- [ ] **Typing indicators in groups** - Show "John is typing..." in group chats
- [ ] **Activity indicators** - "Recently active" for users seen in past hour
- [ ] **Privacy controls** - Let users hide their online status
- [ ] **Group presence analytics** - "Most active members" insights

## Authoring Notes

- **Vertical Slice**: This PR delivers complete group presence visibility - users can see all member statuses and get real-time updates
- **Service Layer**: Extend existing `PresenceService` with group methods - keep single-user methods unchanged
- **SwiftUI Views**: Create reusable components (`OnlineIndicator`, `ProfilePhotoWithPresence`) for consistency
- **Testing**: Focus on multi-device real-time sync and memory leak prevention
- **Performance**: Prioritize listener efficiency (reuse, debouncing, lazy loading) to support large groups
- **Reference**: Follow patterns in `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for real-time messaging, performance, and testing
