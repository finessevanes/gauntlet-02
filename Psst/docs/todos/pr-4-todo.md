# PR-4 TODO — App Navigation Structure

**Branch**: `feat/pr-4-app-navigation-structure`
**Source PRD**: `Psst/docs/prds/pr-4-prd.md`
**Owner (Agent)**: Caleb (Building Agent)

---

## IMPORTANT: Testing Strategy for This PR

**This TODO uses MANUAL TESTING ONLY.**

- ✅ **Manual testing:** Comprehensive step-by-step test scenarios with explicit checkboxes (Section 6)
- ❌ **Unit tests:** Deferred to future testing PR (see PRD Section 17: Backlog)
- ❌ **Integration tests:** Deferred to future testing PR (see PRD Section 17: Backlog)
- ❌ **UI tests:** Deferred to future testing PR (see PRD Section 17: Backlog)

**Why:** This PR focuses on delivering working navigation infrastructure. Manual testing ensures the user experience is validated by a human, which is critical for foundational UI work. Automated tests will be added in Phase 4 or a dedicated testing sprint once navigation patterns stabilize.

**Your Job:** Complete Sections 1-5 (implementation), then thoroughly complete ALL checkboxes in Section 6 (manual testing). Do NOT skip any test scenarios.

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

**Questions:**
- None outstanding — PRD is complete with all details specified

**Assumptions (confirm during implementation):**
- AuthViewModel from PR #2 exposes `@Published var isAuthenticated: Bool` property
- AuthViewModel from PR #2 has `func logout() async throws` method
- iOS deployment target is 16.6+ (supports SwiftUI TabView and NavigationStack)
- PR #2 authentication flow is fully functional and merged

---

## 1. Setup

- [ ] Create branch `feat/pr-4-app-navigation-structure` from develop
  - Test Gate: Branch created and checked out successfully

- [ ] Read PRD thoroughly (`Psst/docs/prds/pr-4-prd.md`)
  - Test Gate: Understand all requirements, acceptance gates, and navigation flows

- [ ] Read `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for patterns
  - Test Gate: Understand SwiftUI state management patterns and performance targets

- [ ] Confirm app builds and runs successfully

- [ ] Verify AuthViewModel is accessible and has required properties
  - Test Gate: Can import and access `isAuthenticated` and `logout()` from AuthViewModel

---

## 2. Core Navigation Infrastructure

### 2.1 Create RootView (Main Navigation Controller)

- [ ] Create `Psst/Psst/Views/RootView.swift`
  - Test Gate: File created in correct location

- [ ] Implement RootView with conditional navigation logic
  - Observes `AuthViewModel.isAuthenticated` using `@StateObject`
  - Displays `LoginView` when `isAuthenticated == false`
  - Displays `MainTabView` when `isAuthenticated == true`
  - Passes `authViewModel` via `.environmentObject()` to child views
  - Test Gate: View compiles without errors

- [ ] Test RootView conditional rendering in SwiftUI Preview
  - Test Gate: Preview shows LoginView when mocking unauthenticated state
  - Test Gate: Preview shows MainTabView when mocking authenticated state

### 2.2 Create MainTabView (Tab Navigation)

- [ ] Create `Psst/Psst/Views/MainTabView.swift`
  - Test Gate: File created in correct location

- [ ] Implement TabView with 3 tabs
  - Tab 1: "Conversations" with SF Symbol `message.fill` → ConversationListView
  - Tab 2: "Profile" with SF Symbol `person.fill` → ProfileView
  - Tab 3: "Settings" with SF Symbol `gearshape.fill` → SettingsView
  - Use `@State private var selectedTab: Int = 0` for tab selection
  - Test Gate: TabView compiles without errors

- [ ] Configure tab bar styling
  - Set tab labels and icons using `.tabItem { }`
  - Apply accent color for selected tab (if defined in assets)
  - Test Gate: SwiftUI Preview shows all 3 tabs with correct icons and labels

- [ ] Test tab selection persistence
  - Test Gate: Switching between tabs maintains state (tab selection works)
  - Test Gate: No console warnings when switching tabs

---

## 3. Placeholder Views

### 3.1 Create ConversationListView Placeholder

- [ ] Create folder `Psst/Psst/Views/ConversationList/`
  - Test Gate: Folder created

- [ ] Create `Psst/Psst/Views/ConversationList/ConversationListView.swift`
  - Large title: "Conversations"
  - Subtitle: "Coming Soon in Phase 2"

  - Simple centered VStack layout
  - Test Gate: View compiles and renders in SwiftUI Preview

- [ ] Verify placeholder displays correctly in MainTabView
  - Test Gate: Tapping first tab shows ConversationListView
  - Test Gate: No console errors or warnings

### 3.2 Create ProfileView Placeholder

- [ ] Add logout button to SettingsView
  - Access AuthViewModel via `@EnvironmentObject var authViewModel: AuthViewModel`
  - Add "Log Out" button in a `List` or `VStack`
  - Button style: `.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)` with red tint color
  - Test Gate: Button renders correctly in SwiftUI Preview

- [ ] Implement logout functionality
  - Button action calls `Task { try await authViewModel.logout() }`
  - Add error handling with `do-catch` block
  - Display error alert if logout fails
  - Test Gate: Code compiles without errors

- [ ] Verify logout navigates back to LoginView
  - Test Gate: Tapping logout triggers navigation to LoginView (manual test)
  - Test Gate: No console errors during logout flow

---

## 4. App Integration

### 4.1 Update PsstApp.swift

- [ ] Modify `Psst/Psst/PsstApp.swift` to use RootView as root
  - Replace `ContentView()` with `RootView()` in `WindowGroup`
  - Test Gate: App compiles successfully

  - Test Gate: App runs without errors

- [ ] Test app launch flow
  - Test Gate: App launches and displays LoginView (if logged out)
  - Test Gate: App launches and displays MainTabView (if logged in)

---

## 5. View Lifecycle & State Management

  - Log out → LoginView appears
  - Test Gate: Transitions happen smoothly with no delays >200ms

- [ ] Check for memory leaks (optional but recommended)
  - Test Gate: No memory leaks detected when navigating between views
  - Test Gate: Views properly deallocate when not visible
