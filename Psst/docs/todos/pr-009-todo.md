# PR-009 TODO â€” Trainer-Client Relationship System & Contact Management

**Branch**: `feat/pr-009-trainer-client-relationships`
**Source PRD**: `Psst/docs/prds/pr-009-prd.md`
**Owner (Agent)**: Caleb

---

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

**Questions:**
- Q: Should converted prospects remain in Firestore or be deleted?
  - Assumption: Keep with `convertedToClientId` set for conversion tracking (pending user confirmation)
- Q: Where should ContactsView be placed in navigation?
  - Assumption: TBD during implementation, can be adjusted based on UI testing

**Assumptions:**
- Users must have existing Psst accounts to be added as clients (no invitation system)
- Display names are read-only (auto-populated from user profiles)
- Clients are removed (deleted) not archived
- Minimal MVP: no tags, notes, phone fields

      // For now, assume current user is trainer, other is client
      let currentUserID = AuthenticationService.shared.currentUser?.id ?? ""
      let otherUserID = members.first(where: { $0 != currentUserID }) ?? ""

      // Validate relationship exists
      let hasRelationship = try await contactService.validateRelationship(
          trainerId: currentUserID,
          clientId: otherUserID
      )

  ```
  - Test Gate: Code compiles, validation logic correct

  - Test Gate: Validation enforces access control

---

## 9. Firebase Security Rules

- [ ] Open `Psst/firestore.rules`
  - Test Gate: File opens
- [ ] Add rules for `/contacts/{trainerId}/clients/{clientId}`:
  ```javascript
  match /contacts/{trainerId}/clients/{clientId} {
    // Only trainer can read/write their own clients
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == trainerId;
  }
  ```
  - Test Gate: Rules syntax correct
- [ ] Add rules for `/contacts/{trainerId}/prospects/{prospectId}`:
  ```javascript
  match /contacts/{trainerId}/prospects/{prospectId} {
    // Only trainer can read/write their own prospects
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == trainerId;
  }
  ```
  - Test Gate: Rules syntax correct
- [ ] Consider adding relationship validation to `/chats` rules (optional for MVP):
  - Can be simplified: allow all authenticated users for now
  - Backend validation in ChatService is primary enforcement
  - Test Gate: Decision made on rule complexity

  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
  ```
  - Test Gate: Rules deployed successfully, no errors

- [ ] Test query performance with index
  - Load ContactsView with 10+ clients
  - Test Gate: Loads in < 500ms

---

## 11. Migration Script (Existing Users)

  - **Option A:** Cloud Function `functions/migrateExistingChats.ts`
  - **Option B:** Swift command-line script
  - **Decision:** Use Cloud Function for consistency
  - Test Gate: File created
- [ ] Implement migration logic:
  ```typescript
  // For each user with role = "trainer"
  //   Get all chats where user is member
  //   Extract unique participant IDs (exclude trainer)
  //   For each participant:
  //     Check if already in /contacts/{trainerId}/clients
  //     If not: create client relationship
  //       - Get user data from /users/{clientId}
  //       - Create client document with displayName from user
  ```
  - Test Gate: Logic compiles, no errors
- [ ] Add dry-run mode (logs actions without writing)
  - Test Gate: Dry-run outputs expected changes
- [ ] Add safety checks:
  - Backup Firestore before running
  - Run dry-run first
  - Confirm with user before executing
  - Test Gate: Safety checks implemented
- [ ] Test migration on development environment
  - Create test users and chats
  - Run migration
  - Verify all chat participants added as clients
  - Test Gate: Migration works, no data loss
- [ ] Document migration steps in README or migration doc
  - Test Gate: Documentation clear and complete

  ## Summary
  Implements explicit trainer-client relationships with contact management, replacing the "everyone can access everyone" architecture with controlled access.

  ## Changes
  - âœ… ContactService with email lookup for clients
  - âœ… Add/remove clients, add/delete prospects, upgrade prospects
  - âœ… ContactsView with client and prospect lists
  - âœ… UserService email lookup functionality
  - âœ… ChatService relationship validation
  - âœ… Firebase security rules for contacts
  - âœ… Migration script for existing users
  - âœ… Group peer discovery support

  ## Testing
  - [x] Happy path: Add client, add prospect, upgrade prospect, remove client
  - [x] Edge cases: User not found, duplicate email, invalid format
  - [x] Error handling: Offline mode, network timeout
  - [x] Performance: Contact list < 500ms, email lookup < 200ms, search < 100ms
  - [x] Security: Relationship validation enforced
  - [x] Migration: Existing users auto-added as clients

  ## Screenshots

- Check off after completion
- Document blockers immediately
- Reference `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for common patterns
- This is a **brownfield PR** - affects existing ChatService and security rules
- Test thoroughly before creating PR
- Migration script is critical - backup Firestore first
- Feature flag recommended for gradual rollout (can be added later)
