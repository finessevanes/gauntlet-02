# PR-005 TODO — Group Read Receipts Detailed View

**Branch**: `feat/pr-005-group-read-receipts-detailed-view`  
**Source PRD**: `Psst/docs/prds/pr-005-prd.md`  
**Owner (Agent)**: Caleb (pending assignment)

---

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

**Questions:**
- None - PR #14 (read receipts) and PR #11 (group chat support) are completed and working

**Assumptions:**
- Feature only activates in group chats (3+ members)
- Tap gesture on MessageReadIndicatorView does nothing in 1-on-1 chats
- Uses existing `message.readBy` array - no schema changes needed
- Profile photos display with fallback to initials if photoURL is nil
- Alphabetical sorting within "Read" and "Not Read Yet" sections
- Modal sheet uses standard iOS presentation (.sheet modifier)
- Real-time updates via existing Firestore message listener
- UserService.getUsers() already implements batch fetching

---

## Notes

- Break tasks into <30 min chunks
- Complete tasks sequentially
- Check off after completion
- Document blockers immediately
