**Source PRD**: `Psst/docs/prds/pr-007-prd.md`
**Owner (Agent)**: Caleb

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

### Questions
- None - PRD is comprehensive and approved

### Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed):
- Cloud Functions environment already has OpenAI and Pinecone configured (from PR #001)
- RAG Pipeline is functional (PR #005 completed)
- AI Chat Backend is operational (PR #003 completed)
- Extraction uses GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency (cheaper than GPT-4)
- Client messages only (no extraction from trainer messages)
- No auto-expiration of profile items (trainer manually archives)

---

## 1. Setup

- [ ] Create branch `feat/pr-007-contextual-intelligence` from develop

## 8. User-Centric Testing

### Happy Path

- [ ] **User opens conversation ‚Üí Profile banner displays**
  - Test: Open chat with client who has existing profile
  - Expected: Profile banner appears within 500ms with categorized info
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Profile loads quickly, shows injuries/goals/equipment

- [ ] **Client mentions new information ‚Üí AI extracts and updates**
  - Test: Send "My shoulder has been hurting" as client
  - Expected: Within 60 seconds, profile shows "Shoulder pain" in Injuries
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Extraction successful, item appears with timestamp

- [ ] **Trainer taps profile item ‚Üí Navigates to source message**
  - Test: Tap "Shoulder pain" in profile banner
  - Expected: Chat scrolls to original message within 1 second
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Navigation works, message highlighted

### Edge Cases

- [ ] **Edge Case 1: Empty profile (first conversation)**
  - Test: Open conversation with new client, no messages yet
  - Expected: Shows empty state: "No profile data yet..."
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Empty state displays, no errors

- [ ] **Edge Case 2: Duplicate information mentioned**
  - Test: Client mentions "shoulder pain" twice
  - Expected: Profile shows single entry with most recent timestamp
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Duplicate detection works

- [ ] **Edge Case 3: Ambiguous information**
  - Test: Client says "I'm traveling next week"
  - Expected: Extracted with Medium confidence, flagged for review
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Confidence indicator shows, trainer can edit

- [ ] **Edge Case 4: Very long profile (100+ items)**
  - Test: Open profile modal with 100+ items
  - Expected: Smooth scrolling, no lag
  - Pass: ‚úÖ LazyVStack used, performance acceptable

### Error Handling

- [ ] **Offline Mode**
  - Test: Enable airplane mode ‚Üí load profile
  - Expected: Cached profile displays, "Offline" banner shown
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Offline access works

- [ ] **Extraction Failure**
  - Test: Simulate Cloud Function timeout
  - Expected: Message sends successfully, extraction retries in background
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Graceful degradation, no user-facing error

- [ ] **Invalid Profile Data**
  - Test: Corrupt profile data in Firestore
  - Expected: Error state: "Couldn't load profile. Tap to retry."
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Error handled gracefully

- [ ] **Permission Denied**
  - Test: Attempt to access profile for non-assigned client
  - Expected: "You don't have permission" message
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Security rules enforced

### Manual Editing

- [ ] **Trainer edits profile item**
  - Test: Edit "Shoulder pain" ‚Üí "Shoulder impingement" ‚Üí Save
  - Expected: Update saves within 1 second, new text displays
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Edit successful, marked as manually edited

- [ ] **Trainer deletes profile item**
  - Test: Swipe to delete "Shoulder pain"
  - Expected: Item deleted within 1 second, disappears from UI
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Deletion successful

- [ ] **Trainer adds manual entry**
  - Test: Add manual "Goals" entry: "Run 5K"
  - Expected: Item created with "manual" source tag
  - Pass: ‚úÖ Manual item appears in Goals section

### Final Checks

- [ ] **No console errors** during all test scenarios
- [ ] **Feature feels responsive** (no noticeable lag)
- [ ] **Multi-device sync works** (optional: verify profile updates across devices)
