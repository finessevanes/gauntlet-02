## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

- Questions: None (PRD comprehensive)
- Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed):
  - PR #010A (Calendar Foundation) is already merged
  - Firestore `/calendar/{eventId}` collection exists with base fields
  - CalendarService.swift exists from PR #010A
  - Google Sign-In SDK for iOS will be used for OAuth

---

## 1. Setup

- [x] Create branch `feat/pr-010c-google-calendar-sync` from develop
- [x] Read PRD thoroughly (`Psst/docs/prds/pr-010c-prd.md`)
- [x] Read `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for patterns
- [x] OAuth 2.0 implementation (using native ASWebAuthenticationSession instead of SDK)
  - Using native iOS OAuth flow (no SDK dependency)
  - Test Gate: Implementation complete, awaiting OAuth credentials
- [ ] Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console
  - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID for iOS
  - Add URL scheme to Info.plist
  - Test Gate: OAuth setup validated with test sign-in
- [x] Confirm environment and test runner work

---

## 2. Data Model Extensions

Extend existing models from PR #010A to support Google Calendar sync.

- [x] Extend `CalendarEvent.swift` model
  - Add `googleCalendarEventId: String?` field
  - Add `syncedAt: Date?` field
  - Add computed property `isSynced: Bool`
  - Add computed property `syncStatusText: String`
  - Test Gate: Model compiles, Codable conformance intact ✅

- [x] Extend `User.swift` model
  - Add `integrations: UserIntegrations?` nested struct
  - Add `UserIntegrations` struct with `googleCalendar: GoogleCalendarIntegration?`
  - Add `GoogleCalendarIntegration` struct with `refreshToken`, `connectedAt`, `connectedEmail`
  - Add computed property `isGoogleCalendarConnected: Bool`
  - Test Gate: Model compiles, Codable conformance intact ✅

- [ ] Update Firestore schema in Firebase Console
  - Add `googleCalendarEventId` and `syncedAt` fields to `/calendar/{eventId}` documents (nullable)
  - Add `integrations.googleCalendar` nested object to `/users/{uid}` documents
  - Test Gate: Firestore schema updated, no migration errors (will auto-create on first sync)

---

## 3. Service Layer - GoogleCalendarSyncService

Implement deterministic service for Google Calendar OAuth and sync operations.

- [x] Create `GoogleCalendarSyncService.swift`
  - Using ASWebAuthenticationSession (native iOS OAuth)
  - Add @Published properties: `isConnected`, `connectedEmail`, `syncStatus`
  - Test Gate: File compiles, service initializes ✅

- [x] Implement OAuth connection method: `connectGoogleCalendar() async throws -> Bool`
  - Use GIDSignIn for OAuth 2.0 flow
  - Request scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
  - Store refresh token in Firestore `/users/{uid}/integrations/googleCalendar`
  - Update User model with `connectedAt` and `connectedEmail`
  - Test Gate: OAuth flow completes → refresh token stored → returns true

- [ ] Implement disconnection method: `disconnectGoogleCalendar() async throws`
  - Revoke OAuth token via GIDSignIn
  - Delete refresh token from Firestore
  - Clear local state (`isConnected = false`)
  - Don't delete Google Calendar events (leave user's data intact)
  - Test Gate: Token revoked → Firestore cleared → isConnected = false

- [ ] Implement connection status check: `checkConnectionStatus() async -> Bool`
  - Read refresh token from Firestore
  - Validate token (check expiry)
  - Update `isConnected` and `connectedEmail` state
  - Test Gate: Returns true if connected, false otherwise

- [ ] Implement sync method: `syncEventToGoogle(event: CalendarEvent) async throws -> String`
  - If `event.googleCalendarEventId` exists → UPDATE existing Google event
  - If `event.googleCalendarEventId` is nil → CREATE new Google event
  - Use Google Calendar API v3: `POST /calendars/primary/events` (create) or `PUT /calendars/primary/events/{eventId}` (update)
  - Map CalendarEvent fields to Google Calendar event format
  - Return Google event ID
  - Test Gate: Create syncs new event → Returns Google event ID | Update syncs without duplication

- [ ] Implement delete method: `deleteEventFromGoogle(googleEventId: String) async throws`
  - Use Google Calendar API: `DELETE /calendars/primary/events/{eventId}`
  - Handle 404 (event already deleted) gracefully
  - Test Gate: Deletes event → Returns success | Handles 404 gracefully

- [ ] Implement token refresh logic: `refreshAccessToken() async throws -> String` (private)
  - Detect 401 (unauthorized) response from Google API
  - Use GIDSignIn to refresh access token using refresh token
  - Return new access token
  - Throw error if refresh token invalid (user needs to reconnect)
  - Test Gate: Expired token → Auto-refreshes → Returns new token | Invalid refresh token → Throws authFailed error

- [ ] Implement retry with exponential backoff: `retrySyncWithBackoff(event: CalendarEvent, attempt: Int) async throws -> String`
  - On network failure: retry after 5s (attempt 1), 10s (attempt 2), 30s (attempt 3)
  - Max 3 attempts → throw syncFailed error
  - Handle rate limiting (429): check `Retry-After` header → wait → retry
  - Test Gate: Network failure → Retries 3 times → Throws error after | Rate limit → Waits → Retries successfully

- [ ] Implement backfill method: `backfillExistingEvents(trainerId: String) async throws`
  - Query Firestore `/calendar` for events in last 30 days where `googleCalendarEventId == nil`
  - For each event: call `syncEventToGoogle()` → update Firestore with returned Google event ID
  - Run in background (don't block OAuth completion)
  - Test Gate: Connect Google Calendar → All recent events sync within 30 seconds

- [ ] Add error enum: `GoogleCalendarError`
  - Cases: `notConnected`, `authFailed(String)`, `permissionDenied`, `syncFailed(String)`, `rateLimitExceeded(retryAfter: Int)`, `tokenRefreshFailed`, `networkError`
  - Implement `LocalizedError` conformance with user-friendly messages
  - Test Gate: Each error case has clear error message

---

## 4. Service Layer - Integrate Sync into CalendarService

Enhance existing CalendarService from PR #010A to trigger Google sync.

- [ ] Modify `CalendarService.createEvent()` method
  - After creating event in Firestore → Check `GoogleCalendarSyncService.isConnected`
  - If connected → Call `Task { try await googleCalendarService.syncEventToGoogle(event) }`
  - On success → Update Firestore with `googleCalendarEventId` and `syncedAt`
  - On failure → Log error (event still created in Psst, sync can be retried)
  - Test Gate: Create event → Syncs to Google → Firestore updated with Google ID

- [ ] Modify `CalendarService.updateEvent()` method
  - After updating event in Firestore → Trigger re-sync to Google (UPDATE, not create)
  - Use existing `googleCalendarEventId` from event model
  - Test Gate: Update event time → Google Calendar event updated (not duplicated)

- [ ] Modify `CalendarService.deleteEvent()` method
  - Before deleting from Firestore → Delete from Google Calendar if `googleCalendarEventId` exists
  - Call `googleCalendarService.deleteEventFromGoogle(googleEventId)`
  - Then delete from Firestore
  - Test Gate: Delete event → Removed from Google Calendar → Removed from Firestore

- [ ] Add manual retry method: `retryGoogleSync(eventId: String) async throws`
  - Fetch event from Firestore
  - Call `googleCalendarService.syncEventToGoogle(event)`
  - Update Firestore on success
  - Test Gate: Failed sync → Tap [Retry] → Syncs successfully

---

## 5. UI Components

Create UI for OAuth connection, sync status, and error handling.

- [ ] Create `CalendarSettingsView.swift`
  - Section: "Google Calendar Integration"
  - If not connected: [Connect to Google Calendar] button
  - If connected: "✅ Connected: {email}" with [Disconnect] button
  - Show last sync timestamp (if available)
  - Test Gate: SwiftUI Preview renders | Tap Connect → OAuth flow triggered | Tap Disconnect → Confirmation alert

- [ ] Create `GoogleCalendarConnectionView.swift`
  - OAuth connection UI with explanation text
  - "Psst will sync your sessions to Google Calendar so you see them alongside your personal appointments."
  - [Connect] button → calls `GoogleCalendarSyncService.connectGoogleCalendar()`
  - Loading state during OAuth flow
  - Success state → Dismiss view, show toast "✅ Connected to Google Calendar"
  - Error state → Show error message with [Retry] button
  - Test Gate: OAuth completes → Success message shown | OAuth fails → Error message with retry

- [ ] Create `EventSyncStatusBadge.swift` (reusable component)
  - Input: `CalendarEvent` (reads `googleCalendarEventId`, `syncedAt`)
  - Visual states:
    - ✅ "Synced" (green badge) if `googleCalendarEventId` exists
    - ⏳ "Syncing..." (yellow, animated) if sync in progress (state from service)
    - ❌ "Sync failed" (red) if sync failed (state from service)
  - Compact design (badge overlay on event card)
  - Test Gate: SwiftUI Preview shows all 3 states correctly

- [ ] Create `SyncRetryButton.swift`
  - Small [Retry] button for failed syncs
  - Calls `CalendarService.retryGoogleSync(eventId)`
  - Shows loading spinner while retrying
  - Test Gate: Tap Retry → Loading shown → Success/Failure handled

- [ ] Create `GoogleCalendarStatusBanner.swift`
  - Top banner in CalendarView when Google Calendar disconnected
  - "⚠️ Google Calendar disconnected. [Reconnect]"
  - Tap [Reconnect] → Opens OAuth flow
  - Dismissible (X button)
  - Test Gate: Shows when disconnected | Tap Reconnect → OAuth flow | Tap X → Dismisses

- [ ] Modify `SettingsView.swift`
  - Add "Calendar" section after Profile section
  - Tap "Calendar" → Opens CalendarSettingsView
  - Show connection status badge: "✅ Connected" or "⚠️ Not connected"
  - Test Gate: Settings shows Calendar section | Tap → Opens CalendarSettingsView

- [ ] Modify `EventDetailView.swift`
  - Add sync status row: "Google Calendar: ✅ Synced 2 minutes ago"
  - If sync failed: Show [Retry Sync] button
  - Test Gate: Event detail shows sync status | Retry button works

- [ ] Modify `EventCardView.swift` (CalendarView event cards)
  - Add `EventSyncStatusBadge` overlay in top-right corner
  - Badge only shows when sync status is not "Synced" (to reduce clutter)
  - Test Gate: Event card shows sync badge when syncing/failed | Hides when synced

## 6. Integration & Real-Time

Reference requirements from `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md`.

- [ ] Integrate GoogleCalendarSyncService with CalendarService
  - Inject GoogleCalendarSyncService into CalendarService
  - Test Gate: Sync triggers automatically after create/update/delete

- [ ] Test backfill on first connection
  - Connect Google Calendar for first time
  - Verify all existing Psst events (last 30 days) sync to Google Calendar
  - Test Gate: Backfill completes within 30 seconds for 20 events

- [ ] Test sync latency
  - Create event in Psst → Measure time until appears in Google Calendar
  - Target: < 5 seconds (p95)
  - Test Gate: Sync latency < 5 seconds

- [ ] Test offline behavior
  - Create event in airplane mode → Event saved in Psst, "⏳ Syncing..."
  - Re-enable network → Event syncs to Google Calendar
  - Test Gate: Offline event syncs when online

---

## 7. User-Centric Testing

**Test 3 scenarios before marking complete** (see `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md`):

### Happy Path

- [ ] **Scenario 1: First-time connection**
  - Open Settings → Calendar → Tap [Connect to Google Calendar]
  - Complete OAuth flow (select account, allow permissions)
  - **Test Gate:** OAuth completes → Settings shows "✅ Connected: alex@gmail.com"
  - **Pass:** Connection successful, backfill starts

- [ ] **Scenario 2: Event creation with sync**
  - Create event in Psst (manual or AI: "schedule session with Sam tomorrow at 6pm")
  - **Test Gate:** Event saved in Psst → Syncs to Google Calendar within 5 seconds → Badge shows "✅ Synced"
  - Open Google Calendar app → Verify event visible with correct title, time
  - **Pass:** Sync works end-to-end

- [ ] **Scenario 3: Event update (reschedule)**
  - Reschedule event in Psst (change 6pm to 7pm)
  - **Test Gate:** Firestore updated → Google Calendar event updated (not duplicated) → Google Calendar app shows new time
  - **Pass:** Update syncs correctly, no duplicates

- [ ] **Scenario 4: Event deletion**
  - Delete event in Psst
  - **Test Gate:** Firestore event deleted → Google Calendar event removed → Google Calendar app no longer shows event
  - **Pass:** Deletion syncs correctly

### Edge Cases

- [ ] **Edge Case 1: OAuth token expiration**
  - Wait for access token to expire (~1 hour) or manually expire
  - Create event in Psst
  - **Test Gate:** Sync detects expired token → Auto-refreshes using refresh token → Sync succeeds without user intervention
  - **Pass:** Token refresh automatic, no user interruption

- [ ] **Edge Case 2: Refresh token revoked**
  - Revoke Psst access in Google Account settings (google.com/permissions)
  - Create event in Psst
  - **Test Gate:** Sync fails → Banner shows "⚠️ Google Calendar disconnected. [Reconnect]" → Event still saved in Psst
  - **Pass:** Clear reconnect prompt, event not lost

- [ ] **Edge Case 3: Network failure during sync**
  - Enable airplane mode → Create event → Disable airplane mode
  - **Test Gate:** Event saved in Psst → "⏳ Syncing..." → Retries when online → "✅ Synced"
  - **Pass:** Automatic retry works, eventual success

- [ ] **Edge Case 4: Rate limit (429 error) - MOCK**
  - Mock 429 response in test
  - **Test Gate:** System waits (Retry-After header) → Retries → Sync succeeds → User sees "⏳ Syncing..." (no error shown)
  - **Pass:** Rate limit handled transparently

### Error Handling

- [ ] **Sync failure after 3 retries**
  - Mock persistent network failure for 3 retry attempts
  - **Test Gate:** "❌ Sync failed. [Retry]" badge shown with manual retry button → Tap Retry → Succeeds
  - **Pass:** Clear error state, retry option provided

- [ ] **Disconnect Google Calendar**
  - Tap [Disconnect] in Settings → Confirm alert
  - **Test Gate:** Refresh token deleted → Settings shows [Connect] button → Future events don't sync → Existing Google Calendar events remain
  - **Pass:** Disconnection works, doesn't delete user's calendar data

### Final Checks

- [ ] No console errors during all test scenarios
- [ ] Feature feels responsive (subjective - no noticeable lag)
- [ ] All sync status indicators clear and accurate

## Notes

- Break tasks into <30 min chunks
- Complete tasks sequentially
- Check off after completion
- Document blockers immediately
- Reference `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for common patterns and solutions
- **OAuth Setup**: Requires Google Cloud Console configuration before testing (create OAuth 2.0 Client ID, add URL scheme to Info.plist)
- **Testing Tip**: Use Google Calendar app on same device/account to verify sync instantly
- **Performance Target**: Sync should feel "instant" to users (<5 seconds)
