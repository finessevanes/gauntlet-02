**Branch**: `feat/pr-25-presence-multi-listener`  
**Source PRD**: `Psst/docs/prds/pr-25-prd.md`  
**Owner (Agent)**: Caleb

---

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

### Assumptions:
- Firebase Realtime Database is already enabled and configured
- Existing presence system works but has listener conflicts
- Two-device testing will use simulators or physical devices
- Changes are backward-compatible (no breaking changes to other features)

---

## 1. Setup

- [x] Create branch `feat/pr-25-presence-multi-listener` from develop
- [x] Read PRD thoroughly (`Psst/docs/prds/pr-25-prd.md`)
- [x] Read `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for patterns
- [x] Verify Firebase Realtime Database is accessible from app

---

## 2. Phase 1: Logging Infrastructure (Foundation)

**Goal**: Add comprehensive debug logging BEFORE making any functional changes

### 2.1 Update PresenceService Logging
- [x] Add structured logging to `setOnlineStatus()`
  - Log: "‚úÖ Set {userID} status to {online/offline}"
  - Log: "‚ùå Error setting status: {error}"
  - Test Gate: Run app, verify status changes log correctly

- [x] Add structured logging to `observePresence()`
  - Log: "‚ûï Added listener {listenerID} for user {userID} (total: {count})"
  - Log: "üëÅÔ∏è Presence update for {userID}: {üü¢ online / üî¥ offline}"
  - Test Gate: Open chat, verify listener attachment logs appear

- [x] Add structured logging to `stopObserving()`
  - Log: "‚ûñ Removed listener {listenerID} for {userID} (remaining: {count})"
  - Log: "‚ö†Ô∏è No listener found for {userID} with ID {listenerID}" (if not found)
  - Test Gate: Navigate away from chat, verify detach logs appear

- [x] Add structured logging to `stopAllObservers()`
  - Log: "üßπ Stopped all presence observers ({count} listeners removed)"
  - Test Gate: Logout, verify cleanup log appears

### 2.2 Update ChatView Logging
- [x] Add logging to `attachPresenceListener()`
  - Log: "üëÅÔ∏è ChatView: Attached presence listener for {userID}"
  - Test Gate: Open chat, verify log appears

- [x] Add logging to `detachPresenceListener()`
  - Log: "üßπ ChatView: Detached presence listener for {userID}"
  - Test Gate: Navigate back, verify log appears

### 2.3 Update ChatRowView Logging
- [x] Add logging to `attachPresenceListener()`
  - Log: "üëÅÔ∏è ChatRowView: Attached presence listener for {userID}"
  - Test Gate: Load chat list, verify logs for each row

- [x] Add logging to `detachPresenceListener()`
  - Log: "üßπ ChatRowView: Detached presence listener for {userID}"
  - Test Gate: Navigate to chat, verify some rows detach (list unloaded)

### 2.4 Baseline Testing
- [ ] Run app and document current behavior in Debug Log Sheet
  - Test: Open chat list ‚Üí Note which logs appear
  - Test: Tap into chat ‚Üí Note listener attachment sequence
  - Test: Navigate back ‚Üí Note cleanup sequence
  - Test: Open same chat again ‚Üí Look for duplicate listeners
  - **Document findings in PRD Section 18 Debug Log Tracking Sheet**

## 3. Phase 2: Core PresenceService Refactor

**Goal**: Implement multi-listener support with UUID tracking

### 3.1 Update Internal Data Structure
- [x] Change `presenceRefs` from `[String: DatabaseReference]` to `[String: [UUID: DatabaseReference]]`
  - Location: `PresenceService.swift` line ~32
  - Test Gate: App compiles

### 3.2 Refactor `observePresence()` Method
- [x] Change return type from `DatabaseReference` to `UUID`
- [x] Generate unique `UUID()` for each listener
- [x] Update internal storage to use nested dictionary
  - Initialize `presenceRefs[userID] = [:]` if needed
  - Store: `presenceRefs[userID]?[listenerID] = presenceRef`
- [x] Update logging to include listener ID and count
- [x] Test Gate: App compiles, logs show unique UUIDs

### 3.3 Refactor `stopObserving()` Method
- [x] Change signature to `stopObserving(userID: String, listenerID: UUID)`
- [x] Look up specific listener: `presenceRefs[userID]?[listenerID]`
- [x] Remove only that specific listener
- [x] Clean up empty dictionary if no listeners remain:
  ```swift
  if presenceRefs[userID]?.isEmpty == true {
      presenceRefs.removeValue(forKey: userID)
  }
  ```
- [x] Update logging to show remaining listener count
- [x] Test Gate: App compiles

### 3.4 Improve `setOnlineStatus()` for Crash Protection
- [x] Move `onDisconnectSetValue()` BEFORE `setValue()` (always set crash protection first)
- [x] Call `onDisconnectSetValue()` even when going offline (not just online)
- [x] Update logging
- [ ] Test Gate: Force quit app, verify Firebase shows offline within 10 seconds

### 3.5 Verify `stopAllObservers()` Still Works
- [x] Update to iterate nested dictionary structure:
  ```swift
  presenceRefs.forEach { userID, listeners in
      listeners.forEach { _, ref in
          ref.removeAllObservers()
      }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Test Gate: Logout, verify all listeners cleaned up

---

## 4. Phase 3: Update Views to Use New API

**Goal**: Update ChatView and ChatRowView to use UUID-based tracking

### 4.1 Update ChatView
- [x] Add state variable: `@State private var presenceListenerID: UUID? = nil`
  - Location: Around line ~40 with other state variables

- [x] Update `attachPresenceListener()` method (around line ~449):
  ```swift
  presenceListenerID = presenceService.observePresence(userID: contactID) { isOnline in
      DispatchQueue.main.async {
          self.isContactOnline = isOnline
      }
  }
  ```

- [x] Update `detachPresenceListener()` method (around line ~457):
  ```swift
  guard let contactID = otherUserID, let listenerID = presenceListenerID else { return }
  presenceService.stopObserving(userID: contactID, listenerID: listenerID)
  presenceListenerID = nil
  ```

- [x] Add logging (already covered in Phase 1)
- [ ] Test Gate: Open chat, verify listener attaches and detaches correctly in logs

### 4.2 Update ChatRowView
- [x] Add state variable: `@State private var presenceListenerID: UUID? = nil`
  - Location: Around line ~28 with other state variables

- [x] Refactor `attachPresenceListener()` to remove polling loop (around lines ~179-200):
  ```swift
  private func attachPresenceListener() {
      guard !chat.isGroupChat else { return }
      
      Task {
          // Wait for otherUserID to be set by loadDisplayName
          while otherUserID == nil && !Task.isCancelled {
              try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 50_000_000) // 0.05 seconds
          }
          
          guard let contactID = otherUserID, !Task.isCancelled else { return }
          
          // Attach presence listener on main thread and store ID
          await MainActor.run {
              presenceListenerID = presenceService.observePresence(userID: contactID) { isOnline in
                  DispatchQueue.main.async {
                      self.isContactOnline = isOnline
                  }
              }
              print("üëÅÔ∏è ChatRowView: Attached presence listener for \(contactID)")
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- [x] Update `detachPresenceListener()` method (around line ~203):
  ```swift
  private func detachPresenceListener() {
      guard let contactID = otherUserID, let listenerID = presenceListenerID else { return }
      
      presenceService.stopObserving(userID: contactID, listenerID: listenerID)
      presenceListenerID = nil
      print("üßπ ChatRowView: Detached presence listener for \(contactID)")
      
      // Remove user profile listener
      userListener?.remove()
      userListener = nil
  }
  ```

## 8. Performance & Memory Testing

**Goal**: Verify no performance regressions or memory leaks

### 8.1 Chat List Load Performance
- [ ] Chat list with 10+ contacts
- [ ] Measure time to load all statuses
- [ ] Verify < 5 seconds for all statuses to appear
- [ ] Test Gate: All statuses load within 5 seconds

### 8.2 Memory Leak Check
- [ ] Rapidly navigate between chat list and message views 20 times
- [ ] Monitor memory usage in Xcode Debug Navigator
- [ ] Check for steadily increasing memory (indicates leak)
- [ ] If leak suspected, use Xcode Instruments Memory Profiler
- [ ] Test Gate: Memory usage stays stable (no growth over time)

### 8.3 Listener Count Validation
- [ ] After all testing, logout
- [ ] Check final log: "üßπ Stopped all presence observers ({N} listeners removed)"
- [ ] N should be 0 or low number (all should have been cleaned up already)
- [ ] Test Gate: Listener count matches expectations

---

## 9. Documentation & Debug Log Recording

## Notes

- **Logging First**: Complete Phase 1 (logging) before any functional changes
- **Test Incrementally**: Don't skip single-device testing before multi-device
- **Document Issues**: Use Debug Log Tracking Sheet religiously
- **Console Hygiene**: Keep logs clean and structured for debugging
- **Two Devices Essential**: Real-time testing requires 2 simulators/devices
- **Memory Awareness**: Monitor for leaks during rapid navigation
- **Methodical Approach**: Follow phases in order, don't skip ahead
