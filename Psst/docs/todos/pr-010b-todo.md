## 7. User-Centric Testing

**Reference:** `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` - Test 3 scenarios before complete

### Happy Path
- [ ] **Test:** Say "schedule a session with Sam tomorrow at 6pm"
- [ ] **Gate:** AI detects Training, finds Sam, no conflicts
- [ ] **Gate:** EventConfirmationCard shown
- [ ] **Gate:** Tap Confirm ‚Üí Event created
- [ ] **Gate:** Event appears in CalendarView (from PR #010A)
- [ ] **Pass:** Flow completes without errors, event visible in calendar

### Edge Case 1: Conflict Detected
- [ ] **Test:** Create event at 6pm manually, then say "schedule John at 6pm"
- [ ] **Expected:** ConflictWarningCard shows with 3 alternatives (7pm, 8pm, next day)
- [ ] **Test:** Pick 7pm alternative
- [ ] **Pass:** Event created at 7pm, no error

### Edge Case 2: Unknown Client (Auto-Create Prospect)
- [ ] **Test:** Say "schedule a call with Sarah" (Sarah doesn't exist in contacts)
- [ ] **Expected:** AddProspectPromptCard appears
- [ ] **Test:** Tap [Yes, add prospect]
- [ ] **Pass:** Prospect created with `prospect-sarah@psst.app`, event linked to prospect

### Edge Case 3: Ambiguous Name
- [ ] **Test:** Add two clients named "Sam" (Sam Jones, Sam Smith)
- [ ] **Test:** Say "schedule Sam tomorrow at 6pm"
- [ ] **Expected:** AI asks "Which Sam? Sam Jones or Sam Smith?"
- [ ] **Test:** Pick Sam Jones
- [ ] **Pass:** Event linked to correct Sam

### Edge Case 4: Reschedule
- [ ] **Test:** Create event for Sam at 6pm, then say "move Sam's session to 7pm"
- [ ] **Expected:** AI finds event, updates time to 7pm, confirms
- [ ] **Pass:** Event time updated in CalendarView

### Edge Case 5: Cancel
- [ ] **Test:** Create event for Sam, then say "cancel Sam's session tomorrow"
- [ ] **Expected:** AI finds event, updates status to cancelled, confirms
- [ ] **Pass:** Event removed from CalendarView (or grayed out)

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Offline Mode:** Enable airplane mode ‚Üí Try scheduling
  - **Expected:** "No internet connection" message
  - **Pass:** Clear error, no crash

- [ ] **Invalid Date:** Say "schedule Sam yesterday"
  - **Expected:** AI responds "I can't schedule in the past. Did you mean tomorrow?"
  - **Pass:** No event created, clear error message

- [ ] **No Available Alternatives:** Fully book 7 days ‚Üí Try scheduling
  - **Expected:** "No available times in the next week. Please choose a time manually."
  - **Pass:** Error message shown, no crash

### Final Checks
- [ ] No console errors during all test scenarios
- [ ] Conflict detection < 500ms (test with 100+ events)
- [ ] Event type detection >95% accuracy (test 20 different phrases)
- [ ] Feature feels responsive (no noticeable lag)
