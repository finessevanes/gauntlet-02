# PR-12 TODO â€” Online/Offline Presence System

**Branch**: `feat/pr-12-online-offline-presence-system`  
**Source PRD**: `Psst/docs/prds/pr-12-prd.md`  
**Owner (Agent)**: Caleb

## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

- Questions: None - PRD is comprehensive
- Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed):
  - Presence data is minimal (won't impact bandwidth or costs)
  - < 1000 concurrent users for MVP (Firebase free tier sufficient)
  - Firebase Realtime Database free tier supports presence needs
  - Binary online/offline sufficient (no custom statuses needed)
  - 3-second latency target is achievable with Firebase Realtime Database

---

## 1. Setup

- [x] Create branch `feat/pr-12-online-offline-presence-system` from develop
- [x] Read PRD thoroughly (`Psst/docs/prds/pr-12-prd.md`)
- [x] Read `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for patterns
- [ ] Verify Firebase Realtime Database is configured in Firebase Console
- [x] Confirm Firebase Authentication is working (from PR #2)
- [x] Verify existing PRs 1-8 are merged to develop

---

## 2. Data Model

Create UserPresence Swift model.

- [ ] Create `Psst/Psst/Models/UserPresence.swift`
  - Test Gate: File created in correct location

- [ ] Define UserPresence struct
  ```swift
  struct UserPresence: Identifiable, Codable {
      let id: String          // userID

      var lastChanged: Date   // timestamp
  }
  ```
  - Test Gate: Struct compiles without errors

- [ ] Add initializer
  ```swift
  init(id: String, isOnline: Bool, lastChanged: Date = Date()) {
      self.id = id
      self.isOnline = isOnline
      self.lastChanged = lastChanged
  }
  ```

      case .active:
          Task {
              try? await presenceService.setOnlineStatus(userID: userID, isOnline: true)
          }
      case .background, .inactive:
          Task {
              try? await presenceService.setOnlineStatus(userID: userID, isOnline: false)

## Notes

- Break tasks into <30 min chunks
- Complete tasks sequentially (data model â†’ service â†’ UI â†’ integration)
- Check off after completion
- Document blockers immediately
- Reference `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for common patterns
- **Critical:** Test multi-device sync early and often (core feature)
- **Critical:** Verify onDisconnect() hook works (handles crashes)
- **Critical:** Check for memory leaks (listeners must be detached)
- Use Firebase Console to verify presence data structure during development
- Test with physical devices when possible (simulators may not fully test lifecycle)
