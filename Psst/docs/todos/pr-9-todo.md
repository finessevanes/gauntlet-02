## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

- Questions: None - PRD is comprehensive
- Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed):
  - User list will be < 500 users for MVP (client-side search acceptable)
  - Alphabetical sorting by display name is sufficient
  - Sheet presentation preferred over navigation push for UserSelectionView
  - No profile pictures needed for MVP (placeholder initials acceptable)

---

## 1. Setup

- [x] Create branch `feat/pr-9-chat-creation-and-contact-selection` from develop
- [x] Read PRD thoroughly (`Psst/docs/prds/pr-9-prd.md`)
- [x] Read `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for patterns
- [x] Confirm Firebase Firestore and Auth are working
- [x] Verify existing PRs 1-8 are merged to develop

---

## 2. Service Layer - ChatService Extension

Implement chat creation with duplicate prevention in existing ChatService.

- [x] Open `Services/ChatService.swift`
  - Test Gate: File exists from PR #6

- [x] Add ChatError enum before ChatService class
  ```swift
  enum ChatError: LocalizedError {
      case notAuthenticated
      case cannotChatWithSelf
      case invalidUserID
      case firestoreError(Error)
  }
  ```
  - Test Gate: Enum compiles, cases accessible

- [x] Implement `createChat(withUserID:)` method in ChatService
  - Step 1: Get current user ID from Firebase Auth
  - Step 2: Validate targetUserID != currentUserID
  - Step 3: Validate targetUserID is not empty
  - Test Gate: Validation logic prevents self-chat and empty IDs

- [x] Implement duplicate chat detection query
  - Step 1: Query chats where current user is member (arrayContains)
  - Step 2: Filter results client-side for targetUserID in members
  - Step 3: Check members.count == 2 and !isGroupChat
  - Test Gate: Query finds existing 1-on-1 chats correctly

- [x] Implement new chat creation logic
  - Step 1: Generate new chatID with UUID().uuidString
  - Step 2: Create chat dictionary with proper schema (members, timestamps, isGroupChat: false)
  - Step 3: Write to Firestore using setData
  - Test Gate: New chat document appears in Firestore Console

- [x] Add error handling and logging
  - Catch authentication errors
  - Catch Firestore errors
  - Add debug print statements for tracking
  - Test Gate: Errors logged clearly, no crashes

- [x] Test createChat method manually
  - Test Gate: Method compiles without errors
  - Test Gate: Returns chatID string on success

  - Test Gate: File exists from PR #3

- [x] Check if `fetchAllUsers()` method exists
  - Search for "fetchAllUsers" in file

- [x] If method doesn't exist, implement it
  - Query all documents from "users" collection
  - Decode each document as User model
  - Return array of User objects
  - Handle decoding errors with compactMap
  - Test Gate: Method returns all users from Firestore

- [x] If method exists, verify it matches requirements
  - Returns `async throws -> [User]`

  - Handles decoding errors gracefully
  - Test Gate: Method works correctly with test users
