- [ ] On reconnect, all queued messages send < 2 seconds
- [ ] Messages transition: Queued ‚Üí Sending ‚Üí Delivered
- [ ] No duplicate messages from queue
- [ ] Cancel action removes message from queue and UI

### Network Monitoring
- [ ] Offline banner appears when disconnected
- [ ] Banner shows queue count: "Offline - X messages queued"
- [ ] Connected banner shows briefly on reconnect
- [ ] NetworkMonitor detects state changes < 1 second
- [ ] Banner slides smoothly, doesn't cover content

### Error Handling
- [ ] Online send failure shows red "Failed - Tap to retry"
- [ ] Retry action works correctly
- [ ] Failed messages stay in UI until retry succeeds
- [ ] Max 3 retry attempts for queued messages
- [ ] After 3 retries, message marked as failed

### Performance
- [ ] Optimistic UI update < 10ms
- [ ] Cache load time < 500ms offline
- [ ] Queue processing < 2 seconds for 10 messages
- [ ] No UI blocking during queue sync
- [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling maintained
- [ ] App load time < 2-3 seconds (unchanged)

### Visual States
- [ ] Color coding clear: Gray (sending) ‚Üí Yellow (queued) ‚Üí Timestamp (delivered) ‚Üí Red (failed)
- [ ] All animations smooth (status transitions, banner)
- [ ] No layout shifts or jarring updates
- [ ] No console warnings or errors

### Multi-Device
- [ ] Optimistic messages sync correctly across devices
- [ ] Queued messages appear on all devices after reconnect
- [ ] Correct chronological order maintained
- [ ] No race conditions or conflicts

## Notes

- **Optimistic UI is client-side only**: sendStatus field not persisted to Firestore
- **Queue storage**: UserDefaults sufficient for MVP (small data, reliable)
- **Threading**: NetworkMonitor runs on background queue, updates UI on main thread
- **Testing**: Focus on airplane mode testing for offline scenarios
- **Performance**: Keep UI responsive during queue processing (async operations)
- **Reference**: Follow `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md` for threading and performance patterns
- **Priority**: Test edge cases thoroughly (app kill, network flicker, large queue)
