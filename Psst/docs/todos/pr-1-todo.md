## Notes

**Task Breakdown Philosophy**:
- Each task is designed to take < 30 minutes
- Tasks are sequential (complete in order)
- Clear acceptance criteria for every task
- References to PRD sections where applicable

**Key Reminders**:
- This is infrastructure only â€” no UI, no features, no auth flows
- All subsequent PRs depend on this being correct
- Test thoroughly in both Xcode console and Firebase Console
- Firebase project already exists; we're integrating with it
- Document everything for future developers

**Blockers/Questions**:
- None (Firebase project already created and configured)

**References**:
- PRD: `Psst/docs/prds/pr-1-prd.md`
- Shared Standards: `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md`
- Architecture: `Psst/docs/architecture.md`
