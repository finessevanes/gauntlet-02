## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

- **Questions**: None - this is a clear Settings tab redesign
- **Assumptions (confirm in PR if needed)**:
  - Complete Settings redesign from placeholder to professional iOS-style grouped list
  - EditProfileView already exists (just navigation to it, no changes needed)
  - Placeholder views are simple (just text saying "coming soon" with proper nav structure)
  - Uses DestructiveButtonStyle from PR #006A for logout button
  - PR #006B is merged before starting (depends on tab bar styling consistency)

### Design System Consistency
Uses design system from PR #006A and #006B:
- Color: `.blue` accent (tabs), `.red` destructive (logout)
- Typography: iOS text styles (`.headline`, `.subheadline`, `.footnote`)
- Button styles: DestructiveButtonStyle for logout
- iOS-native patterns: `.insetGrouped` list, `NavigationLink`, `Label`, SF Symbols

### Completes Design System Overhaul
This PR completes the PR #006 series (006A → 006B → 006C):
- PR #006A: Authentication screens (clean iOS patterns)
- PR #006B: Main app (FAB, larger avatars, improved spacing)
- PR #006C: Settings (iOS grouped list, professional appearance)

Result: Unified, clean design system across entire app with Signal-like simplicity.
