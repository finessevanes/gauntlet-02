## Implementation Notes (For Pam)

### Phase 5: User Preferences PRD

When creating the User Preferences PRD, include:

1. **Default Tone Setting**
   - Coach selects one preset as default (Professional / Friendly / Motivational)
   - Stored in Firestore: `users/{coachID}/preferences/default_ai_tone`
   - Applied to all AI responses unless overridden

2. **Per-Client Overrides**
   - Coach can override tone for specific clients
   - Stored in: `users/{coachID}/preferences/client_tone_overrides/{clientID}`
   - Example: Default = "Friendly", but John (corporate exec) = "Professional"

3. **System Prompt Construction**
   ```typescript
   // In Cloud Function
   const systemPrompt = `
   You are an AI assistant for a personal trainer.
   Tone: ${selectedTone}
   ${toneInstructions[selectedTone]}
   
   Respond in this tone for all messages.
   `;
   ```

4. **Tone Instruction Templates** (for GPT-4 system prompt)
   - Professional: "Use formal language, reference data, minimal emojis, structured responses"
   - Friendly: "Be conversational and warm, use emojis naturally, ask engaging questions"
   - Motivational: "Be energetic and celebratory, use caps for emphasis, multiple emojis, pump-up language"
