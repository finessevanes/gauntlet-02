## Known Issues

### Message View - Delayed Name/Avatar Loading
**Issue:** In group chat message views, sender names and avatars appear with a delay after the message view loads. Currently shows "..." placeholder while fetching sender names asynchronously.

**Root Cause:** 
- `getSenderName(for:)` method returns "..." placeholder while `fetchSenderName(for:)` runs asynchronously
- Sender names are fetched individually as messages are displayed rather than being prefetched
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed user profiles

**Impact:** Poor user experience with delayed name/avatar appearance in group chats

**Proposed Solution:**
- Prefetch all sender names when chat view loads
- Implement user profile caching for frequently accessed users
- Show loading states instead of "..." placeholders
- Consider preloading user profiles for group members

## Future Enhancements

### Profile Photo Loading Refactor
**Status:** Pending ðŸ”„

**Problem:** Profile photo loading logic is scattered across multiple components with inconsistent caching, error handling, and loading states.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Create centralized `ProfilePhotoManager` service with `@MainActor` for thread safety
- Standardize loading states, error handling, and caching across all components
- Update `ProfilePhotoPreview` and `ProfilePhotoWithPresence` to use centralized manager
- Simplify `UserService` to delegate to `ProfilePhotoManager`
- Add comprehensive unit and UI tests
- Follow SwiftUI best practices with proper thread safety and reactive updates

**Expected Benefits:**
- Centralized profile photo logic in single, well-tested service
- Consistent cache-first strategy across all components
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Improved performance with proper background threading
- Enhanced maintainability with single source of truth
- Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `Psst/Psst/Services/ProfilePhotoManager.swift` - Centralized service
- `Psst/PsstTests/ProfilePhotoManagerTests.swift` - Unit tests
- `Psst/PsstUITests/ProfilePhotoManagerUITests.swift` - UI tests
- Update `ProfilePhotoPreview.swift` - Use ProfilePhotoManager
- Update `ProfilePhotoWithPresence.swift` - Use ProfilePhotoManager
- Update `UserService.swift` - Delegate to ProfilePhotoManager
