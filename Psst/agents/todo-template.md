  - Test Gate: Online/offline states reflect correctly

---

## 6. Testing Validation

**Current**: Manual testing validation (see `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md`)  
**Future**: Automated testing recommendations in `Psst/docs/testing-strategy.md`

- [ ] Configuration Testing
  - Test Gate: Firebase Authentication, Firestore, FCM all connected and working
  - Test Gate: All environment variables and API keys properly configured
  
- [ ] User Flow Testing
  - Test Gate: Complete main user journey end-to-end successfully
  - Test Gate: Edge cases (invalid inputs, empty states, network issues) handled gracefully
  
- [ ] Multi-Device Testing
  - Test Gate: Real-time sync works across 2+ devices within 100ms
  - Test Gate: Messages appear on all connected devices simultaneously
  
- [ ] Offline Behavior Testing
  - Test Gate: App functions properly without internet connection
  - Test Gate: Messages queue locally and send when connection restored
  
- [ ] Visual States Verification
  - Test Gate: Empty, loading, error, success states all render correctly
  - Test Gate: No console errors during testing

---

## 7. Performance

Verify targets from `Psst/agents/shared-standards.md`.

- [ ] App load time < 2-3 seconds
  - Test Gate: Cold start to interactive measured
- [ ] Message latency < 100ms
  - Test Gate: Firebase calls measured
- [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling (100+ items)
  - Test Gate: Use LazyVStack, verify with instruments

---

## 8. Acceptance Gates

Check every gate from PRD Section 12:
- [ ] All happy path gates pass
- [ ] All edge case gates pass
- [ ] All multi-user gates pass
- [ ] All performance gates pass

---

## 9. Documentation & PR

- [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update README if needed
- [ ] Create PR description (use format from Psst/agents/caleb-agent.md)
- [ ] Verify with user before creating PR
- [ ] Open PR targeting develop branch
- [ ] Link PRD and TODO in PR description

---
