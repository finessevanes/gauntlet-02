- TODO: `psst/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md`

---

## Workflow Steps

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Check your YOLO setting in the agent prompt!
> - **YOLO: false** → Create PRD → Stop for user feedback → Create TODO after approval
> - **YOLO: true** → Create both PRD and TODO without stopping

### Step 1: Read and Understand

**A. Read the PR brief:**
1. Open `psst/docs/pr-briefs.md`
2. Find your assigned PR number
3. Read the brief completely
4. Note: deliverables, dependencies, complexity

**B. Read supporting context:**
1. `psst/docs/architecture.md` - How the codebase is structured
2. `psst/docs/prd-full-features.md` - Overall product vision
3. Existing PRDs in `psst/docs/prds/` - See examples

**Key questions to answer:**
- What problem does this solve?
- Who is the user?
- What's the end-to-end outcome?
- What files will be modified/created?
- What are the technical constraints?
- What could go wrong (risks)?

---

### Step 2: Create PRD

**File:** `psst/docs/prds/pr-{number}-prd.md`

**Use template:** `agents/prd-template.md`

**Critical sections to complete:**

#### 1. Summary (1-2 sentences)
State the problem and the outcome clearly.

#### 2. Problem & Goals
- What user problem are we solving?
- Why now?
- List 2-3 measurable goals

#### 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope
Call out what's intentionally excluded to avoid scope creep.

#### 4. Success Metrics
- User-visible metrics (taps, flow completion)
- System metrics (performance targets: <100ms message delivery, <2-3s app load, 60fps scrolling)
- Quality metrics (crash-free rate >99%)

#### 5. Users & Stories
Write 3-5 user stories:
- As a [role], I want [action] so that [outcome]

#### 6. Experience Specification (UX)
- Entry points and flows
- Visual behavior (buttons, gestures, animations)
- Loading/disabled/error states
- Performance targets (60fps scrolling, <50ms tap feedback, <100ms message delivery)

#### 7. Functional Requirements
Break down MUST vs SHOULD requirements.

For each requirement, add acceptance gates:
- [Gate] When User A sends message → User B sees it in <100ms
- [Gate] Error case: invalid input shows alert; no partial writes to Firebase

#### 8. Data Model
Describe any new/changed Firestore documents or fields:
```swift
{
  id: String,
  text: String,
  senderID: String,
  timestamp: Timestamp,  // FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
  readBy: [String]  // Array of user IDs
}
```

#### 9. API / Service Contracts
Specify concrete service methods:
```swift
func sendMessage(chatID: String, text: String) async throws -> String
func markMessageAsRead(messageID: String, userID: String) async throws
```

Include:
- Parameters and types
- Validation rules
- Return values
- Error conditions

#### 10. UI Components to Create/Modify
List all files to be touched:
- `Views/ChatView.swift` - Main chat interface
- `Views/MessageRow.swift` - Individual message display
- `Services/MessageService.swift` - Add sendMessage method
- etc.

#### 11. Test Plan & Acceptance Gates
Define BEFORE implementation. Use checkboxes:

- Happy Path
  - [ ] User sends message → appears immediately (optimistic UI)
  - [ ] Message appears in chat view
  - [ ] Gate: Message saves to Firestore in <100ms
  
- Edge Cases
  - [ ] Empty message rejected
  - [ ] Offline message queues for later
  
- Multi-User
  - [ ] User A sends message → User B sees in <100ms
  - [ ] Both users send simultaneously → no conflicts

- Performance
  - [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling with 100+ messages
  - [ ] App load time < 2-3 seconds

#### 12. Definition of Done
Complete checklist:
- [ ] Service methods implemented and unit-tested (XCTest)
- [ ] SwiftUI views implemented with all states
- [ ] Real-time sync verified across 2+ devices (<100ms)
- [ ] All acceptance gates pass

#### 13. Risks & Mitigations
Identify 3-5 risks:
- Risk: [area] → Mitigation: [approach]

---

### Step 2.5: Check YOLO Mode

**🛑 STOP HERE if YOLO: false!**

If **YOLO: false** in your agent prompt:
1. Present the completed PRD to the user
2. Wait for their review and feedback
3. Make any requested changes
4. Only proceed to Step 3 after receiving explicit approval

If **YOLO: true**:
- Continue directly to Step 3 without stopping

---

### Step 3: Create TODO

**File:** `psst/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md`

**Use template:** `agents/todo-template.md`

**Break down the PRD into step-by-step tasks:**

#### Guidelines:
1. Each task should be < 30 min of work
2. Tasks should be sequential (do A before B)
3. Use checkboxes for tracking
4. Group related tasks into sections
5. Include acceptance criteria for each task

#### Sections to include:

**1. Setup**
- [ ] Create branch: `feat/pr-{number}-{feature-name}`
- [ ] Read PRD thoroughly
- [ ] Understand all requirements

**2. Data Model**
- [ ] Define new message type in Swift models
- [ ] Update Firestore schema if needed
- [ ] Add Firebase security rules

**3. Service Layer**
- [ ] Add `sendMessage()` method to MessageService
- [ ] Add `observeMessages()` listener
- [ ] Add validation logic
- [ ] Test in Firebase emulator

**4. UI Components**
- [ ] Add message input view to ChatView
- [ ] Add send button with active state
- [ ] Wire up tap handler

**5. Message Sending Logic**
- [ ] Add message send state
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI update
- [ ] Handle message send to Firebase
- [ ] Handle send errors gracefully
- [ ] Queue messages when offline

**6. Message Rendering**
- [ ] Add MessageRow SwiftUI view
- [ ] Render message text and timestamp
- [ ] Handle sender vs receiver styling
- [ ] Show read receipts
- [ ] Handle long messages

**7. Real-Time Sync**
- [ ] Test message delivery across devices
- [ ] Verify sync latency <100ms
- [ ] Handle concurrent messaging

**8. Testing**
- [ ] Write XCTest unit tests for service
- [ ] Write XCUITest UI tests
- [ ] Test offline mode
- [ ] All tests pass

**9. Polish**
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Handle errors with alerts
- [ ] Performance check (smooth scrolling)

**10. Documentation**
- [ ] Update README if needed
- [ ] Add inline code comments
- [ ] Create PR description

---

### Step 4: Review and Finalize

**Self-review checklist:**

#### PRD Completeness:
- [ ] All template sections filled out
- [ ] Acceptance gates defined for every requirement
- [ ] Data model clearly specified
- [ ] Service contracts documented
- [ ] Test plan comprehensive
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigations

#### TODO Quality:
- [ ] Tasks are small (< 30 min each)
- [ ] Tasks are sequential
- [ ] Each task has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] All PRD requirements covered
- [ ] Testing tasks included
- [ ] Documentation tasks included

#### Clarity:
- [ ] Technical terms explained
- [ ] No ambiguous requirements
- [ ] Clear success criteria
- [ ] Examples provided where helpful

---

### Step 5: Handoff

**Handoff depends on YOLO setting:**

#### If YOLO: false
You already presented the PRD in Step 2.5 and received feedback. Now:

1. Notify user that TODO is complete
2. Provide file paths:
   - `psst/docs/prds/pr-{number}-prd.md` (already reviewed)
   - `psst/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md` (new)
3. Summarize the TODO breakdown
4. Wait for final approval before handing off to Building Agent

#### If YOLO: true
This is the first time presenting both documents. Now:

1. Notify user that PRD and TODO are both ready
2. Provide file paths:
   - `psst/docs/prds/pr-{number}-prd.md`
   - `psst/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md`
3. Summarize key points:
   - Main deliverables
   - Estimated complexity
   - Key risks to watch for
   - TODO task breakdown
4. Wait for user approval before implementation starts

**User will review and may ask for:**
- Clarifications
- Additional details
- Scope adjustments
- Risk mitigation strategies
- TODO reorganization

## Best Practices

### Writing Requirements:
- ✅ Be specific and measurable
- ✅ Include acceptance criteria
- ✅ Define both happy path and edge cases
- ✅ Consider performance from the start
- ❌ Don't be vague ("make it better")
- ❌ Don't skip error cases
- ❌ Don't ignore constraints

### Writing TODOs:
- ✅ Break work into small chunks
- ✅ Start with data/backend, then UI
- ✅ Test as you go (not all at the end)
- ✅ Include time for polish
- ❌ Don't create giant tasks
- ❌ Don't skip testing steps
- ❌ Don't forget documentation

### Real-Time Messaging Focus:
Every feature MUST address:
- How does it sync across devices?
- What's the latency target? (<100ms)
- How do concurrent messages work?
- What happens if a user goes offline?

### Performance Requirements:
Every feature MUST maintain:
- Smooth 60fps scrolling
- <100ms message delivery latency
- <2-3s app load time
- Works with 100+ messages in chat
- Smooth animations
- No UI blocking

---

## Example Output

### Good PRD Summary:
```
Add real-time message delivery feature. Users tap send button,
message appears instantly with optimistic UI, and syncs to Firestore
in real-time so all chat participants see it within 100ms.
```

### Good TODO Task:
```
- [ ] Implement message send handler
  - Capture text from input field
  - Add message to local state array
  - Show optimistic "sending..." indicator
  - Send to Firebase asynchronously
  - Update UI when confirmed delivered
  - Acceptance: Message appears immediately, syncs within 100ms
```

### Good Acceptance Gate:
```
[Gate] When User A sends a message → User B sees the message appear 
in real-time within 100ms with matching timestamp and sender info.
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Vague requirements:** "Make it better" → ✅ "Message delivery < 100ms latency"

❌ **Missing edge cases:** Only happy path → ✅ "What if user sends message while offline?"

❌ **No acceptance criteria:** "Add button" → ✅ "Add send button, tapping sends message, shows optimistic UI"

❌ **Giant tasks:** "Implement entire feature" → ✅ Break into 10+ small tasks

❌ **Ignoring sync:** Only local behavior → ✅ "Message syncs to Firestore, other users see update"

❌ **Forgetting tests:** No test tasks → ✅ "Write XCTest unit test, write XCUITest UI test"

❌ **Ignoring YOLO:** Creating both docs when YOLO: false → ✅ Check YOLO, stop after PRD if false

---

**Remember:** 
- A great PRD + TODO sets up the coder agent for success
- Always check your YOLO setting and follow the correct workflow
- Take your time, be thorough, and think through edge cases!
