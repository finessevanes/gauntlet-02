## 1. Summary

One or two sentences that state the problem and the outcome. Focus on the minimum vertical slice that delivers user value independently.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

- What user problem are we solving?
- Why now? (tie to rubric/OKR if relevant)
- Goals (ordered, measurable):
  - [ ] G1 — [clear goal]
  - [ ] G2 — [clear goal]

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

Call out anything intentionally excluded to avoid partial implementations and hidden dependencies.

- [ ] Not doing X (explain why)
- [ ] Not doing Y (explain why)

---

## 4. Success Metrics

- User-visible: [time to complete task, number of taps, flow completion]
- System: [<100ms message delivery, <2-3s app load time, smooth 60fps scrolling]
- Quality: [0 blocking bugs, all acceptance gates pass, crash-free rate >99%]

---

## 5. Users & Stories

- As a [role], I want [action] so that [outcome].
- As a [collaborator], I want [real-time effect] so that [coordination].

---

## 6. Experience Specification (UX)

- Entry points and flows: [where in app navigation, how it's triggered]
- Visual behavior: [buttons, gestures, empty states, animations]
- Loading/disabled/error states: [what user sees/feels]
- Performance: Smooth 60fps scrolling; tap feedback <50ms; message delivery <100ms.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (Must/Should)

- MUST: [deterministic service-layer method exists for each user action]
- MUST: [real-time message delivery to other users in <100ms]
- MUST: [offline persistence and queue for sent messages]
- SHOULD: [optimistic UI for message sending]

Acceptance gates embedded per requirement:

- [Gate] When User A sends message → User B sees it in <100ms.
- [Gate] Offline: sent messages queue and deliver on reconnect.
- [Gate] Error case: invalid input shows alert; no partial writes to Firebase.

---

## 8. Data Model

Describe new/changed Firestore collections, schemas, and invariants.

```swift
// Example: Message Document
{
  id: String,
  text: String,
  senderID: String,
  timestamp: Timestamp,  // FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
  readBy: [String]  // Array of user IDs
}

// Example: Chat Document
{
  id: String,
  members: [String],  // Array of user IDs
  lastMessage: String,
  lastMessageTimestamp: Timestamp,
  isGroupChat: Bool
}
```

- Validation rules: [Firebase security rules, field constraints]
- Indexing/queries: [Firestore listeners, composite indexes]

---

## 9. API / Service Contracts

Specify the concrete methods at the service layer. Include parameters, validation, return values, and error conditions.

```swift
// Example signatures (Swift/Firebase)
func sendMessage(chatID: String, text: String) async throws -> String
func createChat(members: [String], isGroup: Bool) async throws -> String
func observeMessages(chatID: String, completion: @escaping ([Message]) -> Void) -> ListenerRegistration
func markMessageAsRead(messageID: String, userID: String) async throws
```

- Pre- and post-conditions for each method
- Error handling strategy (surface via alerts, retries, offline queue, etc.)

---

## 10. UI Components to Create/Modify

List SwiftUI views/files to be added/edited with a one-line purpose each.

- `Views/LoginView.swift` — user authentication (login)
- `Views/SignUpView.swift` — user registration (sign up)
- `Views/ChatListView.swift` — display all conversations
- `Views/ChatView.swift` — main chat interface
- `Views/MessageRow.swift` — individual message display
- `Components/MessageInputView.swift` — text input and send button

---

## 11. Integration Points

- Firebase Authentication for user sessions
- Firestore for message/chat storage and real-time listeners
- Firebase Realtime Database for online/offline presence
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications
- State management via SwiftUI `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`

---

## 12. Test Plan & Acceptance Gates

Define BEFORE implementation. Use checkboxes; each sub-task must have a gate.

- Happy Path
  - [ ] User sends message; appears immediately (optimistic UI)
  - [ ] Gate: Other user(s) receive message in <100ms
  - [ ] Gate: Messages persist after app restart (offline cache)
- Edge Cases
  - [ ] Empty message rejected with clear feedback
  - [ ] Offline messages queue and send on reconnect
  - [ ] Invalid user permissions handled gracefully
- Multi-User (Group Chat)
  - [ ] Messages delivered to all group members
  - [ ] Read receipts update for each user independently
- Performance
  - [ ] App load time < 2-3 seconds
  - [ ] Smooth 60fps scrolling with 100+ messages
  - [ ] Message send/receive latency < 100ms

---

## 13. Definition of Done (End-to-End)

- [ ] Service methods implemented and unit-tested (XCTest)
- [ ] SwiftUI views implemented with loading/empty/error states
- [ ] Real-time sync verified across 2+ devices (<100ms)
- [ ] Offline persistence and message queue tested
- [ ] Push notifications working (foreground/background)
- [ ] Test Plan checkboxes all pass
- [ ] Docs updated: README, implementation notes

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: [area] → Mitigation: [approach]
- Risk: [performance/consistency] → Mitigation: [throttle, batch writes]

---

## 15. Rollout & Telemetry

- Feature flag? [yes/no]
- Metrics: [usage, errors, latency]
- Manual validation steps post-deploy

---

## 16. Open Questions

- Q1: [decision needed]
- Q2: [dependency/owner]

---

## 17. Appendix: Out-of-Scope Backlog

Items explicitly deferred for future work with brief rationale.

- [ ] Future X
- [ ] Future Y

---

## Preflight Questionnaire (Complete Before Generating This PRD)

Answer succinctly; these drive the vertical slice and acceptance gates.

1. What is the smallest end-to-end user outcome we must deliver in this PR?
2. Who is the primary user and what is their critical action?
3. Must-have vs nice-to-have: what gets cut first if time tight?
4. Real-time messaging requirements (recipients, <100ms delivery)?
5. Performance constraints (load time, scrolling fps, message latency)?
6. Error/edge cases we must handle (validation, offline queue, Firebase errors)?
7. Data model changes needed (new Firestore collections/fields)?
8. Service APIs required (sendMessage/createChat/observeMessages/etc.)?
9. UI entry points and states (empty chat, loading, offline, error):
11. Security/permissions implications (Firebase rules, user authentication):
12. Dependencies or blocking integrations (Firebase services, APNs):
13. Rollout strategy (feature flag, gradual rollout) and success metrics:
14. What is explicitly out of scope for this iteration?

---

## Authoring Notes

- Write the Test Plan before coding; every sub-task needs a pass/fail gate.
- Favor a vertical slice that ships standalone; avoid partial features depending on later PRs.
- Keep contracts deterministic in the service layer; SwiftUI views are thin wrappers around services.
- Test offline/online transitions thoroughly; Firebase persistence must work seamlessly.
